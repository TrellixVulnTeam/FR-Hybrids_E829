# FR-Hybrids
A batched dataset of hybrid Fanaroff-Riley sources

This dataset is comprised of a total of 104 hybrid FR sources; 63 are labelled as "confidently classified", and make up class 0, and the remaining 41 are labelled as either "uncertainly classified" or "candidate" hybrids. All images are made of data from the VLA FIRST survey, which has been cleaned of noise by sigma-clipping before inclusion. The data is presented in the form of 150 x 150 pixel images, equivalent to an angular size of 270" x 270", in four batches of 26 images; three training batches and one test batch.
